/**
 * Structure describing sets of media formats
 * <p>
 * Caps (capabilities) are lightweight objects describing media types.
 * They are composed of an array of {@link Structure}.
 * <p>
 * Caps are exposed on {@link PadTemplate} to describe all possible types a
 * given pad can handle. They are also stored in the {@link Registry} along with
 * a description of the {@link Element}.
 * <p>
 * Caps are exposed on the element pads using the {@link Pad#getCaps} method. 
 * This method describes the possible types that the pad can handle or produce at runtime.
 * <p>
 * Caps are also attached to buffers to describe the content of the data
 * pointed to by the buffer with {@link Buffer#setCaps}. Caps attached to
 * a {@link Buffer} allow for format negotiation upstream and downstream.
 * <p>
 * A Caps can be constructed with the following code fragment:
 * <p>
 *  <code>
 *  Caps caps = Caps.fromString("video/x-raw-rgb, bpp=32, depth=24, width=640, height=480");
 *  </code>
 * <p>
 * A Caps is fixed when it has no properties with ranges or lists. Use
 * {@link #isFixed} to test for fixed caps. Only fixed caps can be
 * set on a {@link Pad} or {@link Buffer}.
 * <p>
 * Various methods exist to work with the media types such as subtracting
 * or intersecting.
 *
