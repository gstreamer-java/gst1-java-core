 * <p>
 * The flush start event can be sent upstream and downstream and travels
 * out-of-bounds with the dataflow.
 * <p>
 * It marks pads as being flushing and will make them return
 * {@link FlowReturn#FLUSHING} when used for data flow with {@link Pad#pushEvent},
 * {@link Pad#chain}, {@link Pad#getRange} and {@link Pad#pullRange}. Any event
 * (except a {@link FlushStopEvent}) received on a flushing pad will return
 * {@code false} immediately.
 * <p>
 * Elements should unlock any blocking functions and exit their streaming
 * functions as fast as possible when this event is received.
 * <p>
 * This event is typically generated after a seek to flush out all queued data
 * in the pipeline so that the new media is played as soon as possible.
