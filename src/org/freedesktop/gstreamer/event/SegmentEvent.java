/**
 *
 * An event for {@link Segment}
 * <p>
 * See upstream documentation at
 * <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-segment"
 * >https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-segment</a>
 * <p>
 * The segment event marks the range of buffers to be processed. All data not
 * within the segment range is not to be processed. This can be used
 * intelligently by plugins to apply more efficient methods of skipping unneeded
 * data. The valid range is expressed with the start and stop values.
 * <p>
 * The time value of the segment is used in conjunction with the start value to
 * convert the buffer timestamps into the stream time. This is usually done in
 * sinks to report the current stream_time. time represents the stream_time of a
 * buffer carrying a timestamp of start . time cannot be -1.
 * <p>
 * start cannot be -1, stop can be -1. If there is a valid stop given, it must
 * be greater or equal the start , including when the indicated playback rate is
 * {@literal < 0}
 * <p>
 * The applied_rate value provides information about any rate adjustment that
 * has already been made to the timestamps and content on the buffers of the
 * stream. (rate * applied_rate ) should always equal the rate that has been
 * requested for playback. For example, if an element has an input segment with
 * intended playback rate of 2.0 and applied_rate of 1.0, it can adjust incoming
 * timestamps and buffer content by half and output a segment event with rate of
 * 1.0 and applied_rate of 2.0
 * <p>
 * After a segment event, the buffer stream time is calculated with:
 * <p>
 * time + (TIMESTAMP(buf) - start) * ABS (rate * applied_rate)
