 * The purpose of the step event is to instruct a sink to skip amount (expressed
 * in format) of media. It can be used to implement stepping through the video
 * frame by frame or for doing fast trick modes. A rate of {@literal <= 0.0} is
 * not allowed, pause the pipeline or reverse the playback direction of the
 * pipeline to get the same effect.
 * <p>
 * The flush flag will clear any pending data in the pipeline before starting
 * the step operation.
 * <p>
 * The intermediate flag instructs the pipeline that this step operation is part
 * of a larger step operation.
