 * The eos event can only travel downstream synchronized with the buffer flow.
 * Elements that receive the EOS event on a pad can return
 * {@link FlowReturn#EOS} when data after the EOS event arrives.
 * <p>
 * The EOS event will travel down to the sink elements in the pipeline which
 * will then post the {@link Bus.EOS } message on the bus after they have
 * finished playing any buffered data.
 * <p>
 * When all sinks have posted an EOS message, an EOS message is forwarded to the
 * application.
 * <p>
 * The EOS event itself will not cause any state transitions of the pipeline.
