/**
 * A quality message. Used to indicate to upstream elements that the downstream
 * elements are being starved of or flooded with data.
 * <p>
 * See upstream documentation at
 * <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-qos"
 * >https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gstreamer/html/GstEvent.html#gst-event-new-qos</a>
 * <p>
 * <tt>proportion</tt> indicates the real-time performance of the streaming in
 * the element that generated the QoS event (usually the sink). The value is
 * generally computed based on more long term statistics about the streams
 * timestamps compared to the clock.
 * <p>
 * A value &lt; 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is producing data faster
 * than real-time. A value &gt; 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is not
 * producing data fast enough. 1.0 is the ideal <tt>proportion</tt> value. The
 * proportion value can safely be used to lower or increase the quality of the
 * element.
 * <p>
 * <tt>difference</tt> is the difference against the clock in running time of
 * the last buffer that caused the element to generate the QOS event. A negative
 * value means that the buffer with <tt>timestamp</tt> arrived in time. A
 * positive value indicates how late the buffer with <tt>timestamp</tt> was.
 * <p>
 * <tt>timestamp</tt> is the timestamp of the last buffer that cause the element
 * to generate the QOS event. It is expressed in running time and thus an ever
 * increasing value.
 * <p>
 * The upstream element can use the <tt>diff</tt> and <tt>timestamp</tt> values
 * to decide whether to process more buffers. For positive <tt>difference</tt>,
 * all buffers with timestamp <= <tt>timestamp</tt> + <tt>difference</tt> will
 * certainly arrive late in the sink as well.
 * <p>
 * The application can use general event probes to intercept the QoS event and
 * implement custom application specific QoS handling.
