 * The flush stop event can be sent upstream and downstream and travels
 * out-of-bounds with the dataflow. It is typically sent after sending a
 * {@link FlushStartEvent} event to make the pads accept data again.
 * <p>
 * Elements can process this event synchronized with the dataflow since the
 * preceeding FLUSH_START event stopped the dataflow.
 * <p>
 * This event is typically generated to complete a seek and to resume dataflow.
