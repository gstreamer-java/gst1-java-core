/**
 * A sink {@link Element} that provides an easy way for applications to extract
 * samples from a pipeline.
 * <p>
 * See upstream documentation at
 * <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-appsink.html"
 * >https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-appsink.html</a>
 * <p>
 * Appsink is a sink plugin that supports many different methods for making the
 * application get a handle on the GStreamer data in a pipeline. Unlike most
 * GStreamer elements, Appsink provides external API functions.
 * <p>
 * The normal way of retrieving samples from appsink is by using the
 * {@link #pullSample()} and {@link #pullPreroll()} methods. These methods block
 * until a sample becomes available in the sink or when the sink is shut down or
 * reaches EOS. (<em>TODO - not currently mapped in the Java bindings.</em>
 * There are also timed variants of these methods,
 * gst_app_sink_try_pull_sample() and gst_app_sink_try_pull_preroll(), which
 * accept a timeout parameter to limit the amount of time to wait).
 * <p>
 * Appsink will internally use a queue to collect buffers from the streaming
 * thread. If the application is not pulling samples fast enough, this queue
 * will consume a lot of memory over time. The "max-buffers" property can be
 * used to limit the queue size. The "drop" property controls whether the
 * streaming thread blocks or if older buffers are dropped when the maximum
 * queue size is reached. Note that blocking the streaming thread can negatively
 * affect real-time performance and should be avoided.
 * <p>
 * If a blocking behaviour is not desirable, setting the "emit-signals" property
 * to TRUE will make appsink emit the "new-sample" and "new-preroll" signals
 * when a sample can be pulled without blocking.
 * <p>
 * The "caps" property on appsink can be used to control the formats that
 * appsink can receive. This property can contain non-fixed caps, the format of
 * the pulled samples can be obtained by getting the sample caps.
 * <p>
 * If one of the pull-preroll or pull-sample methods return NULL, the appsink is
 * stopped or in the EOS state. You can check for the EOS state with the "eos"
 * property or with the {@link #isEOS()} method.
 * <p>
 * The eos signal can also be used to be informed when the EOS state is reached
 * to avoid polling.
