/**
 * A source {@link Element} that provides an easy way for applications to insert
 * data into a GStreamer pipeline.
 * <p>
 * See upstream documentation at
 * <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-appsrc.html"
 * >https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/stable/gst-plugins-base-libs/html/gst-plugins-base-libs-appsrc.html</a>
 * <p>
 * Before operating appsrc, the {@link Caps} property must be set to fixed caps
 * describing the format of the data that will be pushed with appsrc. An
 * exception to this is when pushing buffers with unknown caps, in which case no
 * caps should be set. This is typically true of file-like sources that push raw
 * byte buffers. If you don't want to explicitly set the caps, you can use
 * gst_app_src_push_sample (<em>not yet mapped</em>). This method gets the caps
 * associated with the sample and sets them on the appsrc replacing any
 * previously set caps (if different from sample's caps).
 * <p>
 * The main way of handing data to the appsrc element is by calling the
 * {@link #pushBuffer(Buffer) } method or by emitting the push-buffer action
 * signal. This will put the buffer onto a queue from which appsrc will read
 * from in its streaming thread. It is important to note that data transport
 * will not happen from the thread that performed the push-buffer call.
 * <p>
 * The "max-bytes" property controls how much data can be queued in appsrc
 * before appsrc considers the queue full. A filled internal queue will always
 * signal the "enough-data" signal, which signals the application that it should
 * stop pushing data into appsrc. The "block" property will cause appsrc to
 * block the push-buffer method until free data becomes available again.
 * <p>
 * When the internal queue is running out of data, the "need-data" signal is
 * emitted, which signals the application that it should start pushing more data
 * into appsrc.
 * <p>
 * In addition to the "need-data" and "enough-data" signals, appsrc can emit the
 * "seek-data" signal when the "stream-mode" property is set to "seekable" or
 * "random-access". The signal argument will contain the new desired position in
 * the stream expressed in the unit set with the "format" property. After
 * receiving the seek-data signal, the application should push-buffers from the
 * new position.
 * <p>
 * These signals allow the application to operate the appsrc in two different
 * ways:
 * <p>
 * The push mode, in which the application repeatedly calls the
 * push-buffer/push-sample method with a new buffer/sample. Optionally, the
 * queue size in the appsrc can be controlled with the enough-data and need-data
 * signals by respectively stopping/starting the push-buffer/push-sample calls.
 * This is a typical mode of operation for the stream-type "stream" and
 * "seekable". Use this mode when implementing various network protocols or
 * hardware devices.
 * <p>
 * The pull mode, in which the need-data signal triggers the next push-buffer
 * call. This mode is typically used in the "random-access" stream-type. Use
 * this mode for file access or other randomly accessable sources. In this mode,
 * a buffer of exactly the amount of bytes given by the need-data signal should
 * be pushed into appsrc.
 * <p>
 * In all modes, the size property on appsrc should contain the total stream
 * size in bytes. Setting this property is mandatory in the random-access mode.
 * For the stream and seekable modes, setting this property is optional but
 * recommended.
 * <p>
 * When the application has finished pushing data into appsrc, it should call
 * {@link #endOfStream() } or emit the end-of-stream action signal. After this
 * call, no more buffers can be pushed into appsrc until a flushing seek occurs
 * or the state of the appsrc has gone through READY.
